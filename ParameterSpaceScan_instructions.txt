This document will explain how to dowload, configure, and run a parameter space search for AraSim on a computing cluster. 
These scripts explore the AraSim parameter space by varying the values for 5 parameters in the setup.txt file. 

#######Script Descriptions########
ParamSearchSetup.sh -> This script sets up the necessary directories and setup files for all the runs
scheduler.sh -> This script submits and monitors all jobs.  

#######DOWNLOAD########
1.Download ParamSearchSetup.sh and scheduler.sh
2.Move both files into your AraSim directory
3.Do $chmod u+x ParamSearchSetup.sh and $chmod u+x scheduler.sh

######CONFIGURE#######
1.Open ParamSearchSetup.sh
2.On line 5, change PCON003 to you group computing name, or remove the whole line.
3.On line 9, specify the location of your AraSim directory
4.On line 10, name the parameter space search
5.On line 11, specify the number if processors per node on your cluster
6.On lines 15-89, edit the setup.txt parameters that you want to keep constant for every run
7.On line 15-89, edit the setup.txt parameters that you want to vary by making the parameter equal to a variable.
     EX. 	  input1="EXPONENT=$E"
     		  input49="number_of_stations=$S"
8.On line 99, replace Var1 with one of the variables you specified in the previous step. Specify a range and interval to vary the parameter by.
     EX.     	  for E in {15..20..1}
9.On line 101-102, replace Var1Name$Var1 with the variable you specified in the previous step.
     EX.     	  mkdir Exponent$E
     		  cd Exponent$E
10.Repeat steps 8-9 for all 5 variables you want to vary on lines 99-122
11.On line 127, replace the default variable names with the variables you are varying. 
      Ex. 	  echo "Counter = $counter ; Exponent = $E ; ...etc
12.Under line 130, redefine all varying parameters. These can be copied from lines 15-89.
      Ex.     	  input1="EXPONENT=$E"
                  input49="number_of_stations=$S"
13.On line 139, replace the existing variable names with the ones you are varying
      EX.  	  runDir=$runName'/'Exponent$E'/'NStations$S...etc
14.On line 144, modify walltime of each run depending on your settings and cluster 
15.On line 147, change PCON003 to you group computing name, or remove the whole line
16.Save file
17.Open sheduler.sh
18.On line 3, specify the location of your AraSim directory
19.On line 4, specify the name of the parameter space search. It should be the same name as in ParamSearchSetup.sh
20.On lines 11-19, modify Var1-Var5 to the actual variable names and correct ranges to iterate over. These for loops should be identical to lines 99-122 in ParamSearchSetup.sh
21.On line 21, replace the existing variable names with the ones you are varying
      Ex.        echo "cd $runName'/'Exponent$E'/'NStations$S...etc
22.On lines 34 and 39, replace cond0091 with your username for the cluster
23.On lines 43, you can pick how many nodes you want to use at any given time. It is set to 10 intially. 
24.Save File


#######RUN#######
1.Do $qsub ParamSearchSetup.sh
2.Wait for ParamSearchSetup.sh to finish. This script is creating the setup files for all runs. This may take a couple minutes.
3.When ParamSearchSetup.sh is done, there should be a new directory in your home directory. Move this directory to your AraSim directory.
4.Do $screen to start a new screen that the scheduler can run on. This is incase you lose connection to the cluster mid run. 
5.Do $./scheduler.sh to start script. This script automatically submits jobs and lets you see the status of the runs.
6.The scheduler makes a text file of all jobs called jobList.txt in the ShelfMC dir. Make sure to delete jobList.txt before starting a whole new run.


######RESULT#######
1.When Completed, there will be a great amount of data in the run files.  
2.The run directory is organized in tree, results for particular runs can be found by cd'ing deeper into the tree.
3.In each run directory, there will be a resulting root file, all the setup files, and a log file for the run.
